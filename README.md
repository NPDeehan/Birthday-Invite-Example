# Birthday Invite Example
Using Camunda and BPMN I've built an example of a process for birthday invites. The purpose is to demonstrate how to integrate with Slack and SendGrid for sending messages with a little bonus of using multi-instance markers to send multiple emails.

## Setup required

This requires a little bit of setup. You‚Äôll need a Camunda 8 account (the easiest place to do that is [Camunda SaaS](https://signup.camunda.com/accounts)). You'll also need to create a [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us) account and you need to create a [Slack](https://slack.com/) Account. Then you need to get a API key for both services. 

### Setting up secretes 

üîê It‚Äôs important to know that it‚Äôs best practice not to simply copy and paste this sensitive information directly into the model but rather to [create a secret](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets/) for each of these in your Camunda cluster. Then you can reference it by typing `{{secrete.yourSecreteHere}}` followed by the name of the key you want to access.

For this example to work you'll need to create secretes with the following names:
* HawkSlack
* SendGrid

## How to deploy it
Once you have both accounts, it's pretty easy to get started. Upload the bpmn model and the forms from their respective folders and add them to your Camunda 8 account. From the modeler you can deploy the process to a cluster. 

You can start the process from the modeler or from tasklist
